# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Visualiser

This is a Streamlit web application that demonstrates and compares classic CPU scheduling algorithms:
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**

The app shows Gantt charts, waiting times, and turnaround times for each algorithm.
